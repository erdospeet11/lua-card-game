Ideas for the game:
  - you choose a starting deck of cards

for the demo you will have one storyline the present.

the game loop will consist of 6-7 events. couple of them are enemy encounters, shops, events

the last boss is the ruler of the timeline.

with the last combination you ascend in time and space.

so first your cards will consist of weapons,sorcery,martial arts combinations to defeat humans or sorcerers.


maybe in the 4th or 5th timeline will be cosmic events and cosmic enemies

Cards:
  - The pulse
  - Cosmic events
  - wraiths
  - founders

combo system:
  - you have an enemy and you have to combine cards to defeat them
  - there are resources that limit how much you can combine

  how to make it different every round and fun?

The cards and enemies all are based on time periods or culture or phenomena
- medieval
- esoteric
- modern
- ancient


🔁 Replayability & Variety Per Round
1. Shifting Epochs (Time/Culture Themes per Run)

Each run takes place in a different Epoch, affecting:

    Available cards (deck themes)

    Enemies and their abilities

    Resource rules or modifiers (e.g., cheaper combos, faster enemy turns)

    Narrative tone or flavor text

Example Epochs:

    The Medieval Collapse – Plague-based enemies, holy vs. unholy cards

    The Esoteric Uprising – Arcane logic, rituals, shadowy wraiths

    Modern Disillusionment – Surveillance, propaganda, nihilistic threats

    Ancient Birth – Founders, primal sorcery, cosmic beasts

2. Deck Archetypes (Starting Decks)

Give the player unique starting decks based on philosophies, factions, or characters:

    Wraithcaller: Disruption and manipulation

    Pulsebound: Chain reactions, delayed effects

    Cosmic Herald: Big power spikes, long combos

    Founder’s Hand: Balance and protection

Each has unique core cards and synergy potential.
🃏 Card & Combo System
1. Combo Grid / Sequencer

Instead of just playing one card at a time:

    The player builds a combo sequence (3-5 cards per turn)

    Each card consumes a resource (like Mana, Pulse Energy, or Time Fragments)

    Some cards require conditions (e.g., "Play after a Cosmic Event" or "If an enemy is Ancient")

Synergy Bonus: Comboing specific card types (e.g., Event → Wraith → Founder) can trigger powerful effects.
2. Resource System

Limit power through:

    Combo Energy: Spent each turn to limit how many/which cards are used

    Affinity Points: Earned by leaning into certain themes (e.g., Ancient, Cosmic), spent for theme-specific bonuses

🧠 Strategic Layer
1. Enemy Archetypes

    Each enemy draws from the same cultural pools (e.g., Esoteric Mage, Modern AI Construct, Ancient Leviathan)

    They may counter certain card types or combos (forcing adaptation)

    Bosses could use reverse cards – playing against you during your combo (e.g., "Interrupt Pulse Flow")

2. Meta Progression

    Unlock new starting decks, combo components, or epochs

    "Evolve" cards mid-run through Chronoshards or Pulse Infusion events

    Pick Perks or Boons between fights (à la Slay the Spire)

🎲 Making Each Run Feel Different

    Random Epoch: Each run occurs in a randomly selected time/culture setting

    Randomized Events: Story beats, mini-bosses, or decisions influenced by the current theme

    Mutation Rules: Add a random rule each run (e.g., “All Wraith cards cost +1”, or “Combos longer than 3 get a +1 buff”)

    Rotating Enemies and Deck Restrictions: Some runs lock certain cards or require using underutilized ones

🧪 Bonus Ideas

    Echo Cards: Powerful cards that "echo" back in time from future runs (meta-narrative)

    Dual Card Types: Cards that behave differently based on the Epoch (e.g., “Prophecy” could buff allies in Ancient, but summon a drone in Modern)

    Lore Unlocks: Defeating enemies or achieving certain combo patterns reveals secrets of the Kozmoz universe  


🔁 Core Loop (Updated)

    Draw Phase – Start with a hand of 5–6 cards.

    Combine Phase – Pick 2–3 cards to fuse into a new, transformed card.

    Resolve Phase – Play the transformed card. It costs resources.

    Optional Utility Cards – Play other cards to manipulate hand, draw, or combo further.

🧪 Card Types
1. Base Cards

Used as ingredients in combos. Not played directly for effects (usually):

    The Pulse

    Founder’s Bone

    Wraith Echo

    Event Horizon

    Occult Map

2. Utility Cards

Used to draw, manipulate, or select combos:

    Vision of the Past – Choose one card from your discard pile

    Foresight Glyph – Draw 2, discard 1

    Twist the Weave – Preview 3 potential transformations and pick one

3. Fusion Outcomes (Transformed Cards)

These are generated by combining base cards and are powerful:

    Starbirth = The Pulse + Wraith Echo → Deal 6 to all enemies, stun Wraith-type foes

    Ancestor Requiem = Founder’s Bone + Occult Map → Revive a used card, weaken enemy

    Temporal Scorch = Event Horizon + The Pulse → Burn over time, disables enemy trait

    Cosmic Seed = Wraith Echo + Founder’s Bone → Apply “growth” to hand, drawing 1 extra next turn for each combo made this turn

🔧 Fusion Rules

You can create recipes with:

    2-card base fusions (common)

    3-card rare fusions (legendary moves)

Each card has:

    Tags (e.g., Cosmic, Esoteric, Founder, Event)

    The fusion logic is based on tag matching and order

Example logic:

Cosmic + Esoteric = Temporal Magic
Founder + Ancient = Resurrection-based fusion
Wraith + Event = Ethereal Invocation

🌌 Strategic Layer

To allow consistent strategy vs. randomness, you can:

    Include “Discovery cards”: let you see 3 possible outcomes of a combo and choose

    Include “Research”: unlocks new combos across runs (meta progression)

    Add Faction decks: Each faction favors certain combos and tags

🧩 Example Turn Flow

    Hand: The Pulse, Occult Map, Wraith Echo, Twist the Weave, Vision of the Past

    Use Twist the Weave: Preview fusion options for Pulse + Echo → Choose Starbirth

    Play Starbirth: AoE + Wraith disable

    Use Vision of the Past: Retrieve Founder’s Bone for next turn

That’s a powerful design: making each card an Epoch or fragment of an era turns every combo into a storytelling moment — like you're building a timeline, vision, or spell out of the pieces of history itself.

This lets the combo system become a metaphor: combining eras = crafting a new fate, summoning a forgotten god, or manifesting a truth from time itself.

Let’s shape this into a full system based on your idea:
🧭 Core Concept: Epoch Cards

Every card = a piece of time, culture, or reality.

You don’t play them directly. Instead, you combine 2–3 cards (epochs) to create a Manifestation — an ability, event, or entity pulled from the timeline.
🔢 Example Epoch Progression

Each card has:

    Epoch Tag (Modern, Future, Cosmic, etc.)

    Perspective Level (Low → High consciousness)

Early Epochs (Low Perspective)

    Industrial Decline

    Modern Warfare

    Urban Decay

    Scientific Dogma

Mid Epochs (Awakening)

    AI Singularity

    Post-Earth Migration

    Cyber Communion

    Neural Collapse

Late Epochs (High Perspective)

    Starseed Memory

    The Pulse

    Eternal Observer

    Founder’s Light

🧪 Fusion System: "Chrono Alchemy"
🌟 You pick 2–3 Epochs → They generate a Manifestation.

    Manifestations are powerful effects, like spells, events, or summons.

    Their nature depends on:

        The tags (e.g., Modern, Cosmic)

        The perspective (low + high = paradox, mid + mid = stable tech, etc.)

        The position (e.g., first card defines base effect, second modifies, third adds flavor or extra power)

📘 Examples of Fusions
Combo: Urban Decay + AI Singularity

→ Manifestation: "Grey Bloom Protocol"

    Corrupt a random enemy. It loses control next turn. Tech-based enemies are stunned.

Combo: Modern Warfare + Starseed Memory

→ Manifestation: "Refraction Rebellion"

    Double damage for all human-origin attacks. Draw 1 additional Epoch next turn.

Combo: The Pulse + Founder’s Light

→ Manifestation: "Return of the Origin"

    Resets all enemy buffs. Revives a discarded Manifestation. Cosmic enemies are weakened permanently.

🔁 Progression & Replayability

    You start with Modern-only Epochs

    As you win or make key fusions, you gain access to deeper time (Future, Cosmic)

    Some Manifestations are locked behind certain tags or rare 3-card combos

    There’s meta-progression too:

        Unlock new Epoch cards (e.g., Wraith Uprising, Temporal Collapse)

        Discover new fusions permanently

        Choose starting "Time Focus" (Modern-heavy deck, Balanced, or Cosmic-chasing)

📦 Supporting Card Types (Optional)

To support this Epoch fusion core:

    Draw Tools: Neural Recall, Archive Break, Echo Path

    Combo Tools: Time Anchor (hold a card between turns), Swap Era, Mirror Perspective

    Discard/Control: Erase Year, Collapse Lineage

🔧 Next Options for You

Would you like:

    A Fusion Chart (e.g., Modern + Future = Cybernetic themes)?

    A list of 20 Epoch cards with flavor + tags + rarity?

    A list of Manifestation results based on combinations?

    A mockup (text/UI sketch) of how this would look in-game?

Let me know your preferred next step — I can help you build it out visually, narratively, or mechanically.

🎮 Act 1: Present-Day Timeline (Demo)
📜 Narrative Theme:

    You are a Seeker lost in the cracks of time, hunted by factions who fear your potential. The Ruler of the Timeline watches from the shadows, manipulating all events to prevent your rise.

🔁 Structure: 6–7 Events
#	Type	Description
1	Intro Event	Narrative setup: You awaken, given a choice of starting cards/deck (Weapon, Sorcery, Martial Arts).
2	Enemy Encounter	Street-level thug gang or rogue mage. Teaches core combat/fusion.
3	Shop/Choice Event	Choose a card or card-enhancer (upgrade, fuse, or peek into another epoch).
4	Enemy Encounter	A cultist or early mini-boss using timeline manipulation (e.g., rewind, copy).
5	Narrative Event	Pick between two choices that affect your deck or next fight (e.g., help a time-walker, destroy a relic).
6	Shop or Rare Card Event	Opportunity to upgrade a card or gain a Fragment of Ascension.
7	Boss Fight	Ruler of the Timeline – The Chronolord (uses a mix of Martial, Sorcery, and denial/control tactics).
🔫 Starting Deck Themes

Let the player choose one of three archetypes at the beginning:
⚔️ Martial

    Brutal Elbow, Focused Breath, Shadow Palm

    Focus on chained combos and close-range power

🔮 Sorcery

    Urban Hex, Burning Thought, Ink Glyph

    Weaker alone, strong when sequenced with Events

🔪 Weapons

    Rusty Blade, Flash Bomb, Trapwire

    Fast effects and tools that manipulate the enemy or hand

👹 Boss: The Chronolord
Tags: Human, Sorcerer, Timeline-Linked
Mechanics:

    Starts with 2 passives:

        “Past Lives”: Plays a weaker copy of one of your previous Manifestations

        “Clock of Denial”: Every 3 turns, locks a random card type (e.g., no Sorcery)

Deck:

    Disrupting Future, Recall the Blade, Seal of Delay, Temporal Duplicate

✨ Tease the Future (End of Demo)

After the final combo:

    “As your will strikes through the veil of the present, time begins to bend... You hear a hum. The Pulse is waking.”

Unlock a splash screen of a Cosmic card (e.g., Starshard Echo) as a teaser.

so you have to combine the end goal by X turns
the enemy can do a negative effect when you combine
the enemy can do a negative effect when you end your turn and it is not defeated

the negative effect can be applied to a card in your hand, can be applied to a card in your deck, create a card and add it to your hand, create a card and add it to your deck, remove a card from your hand, remove a card from your deck


🎯 Core Rule Summary

Goal:
➡️ Create the final Seal (by combining 3 specific talismans) within X turns.

Enemy Role:
The enemy is not interactive in the traditional combat sense, but instead:

    Applies a negative effect each turn (if you haven’t won yet)

    Triggers a punishment effect when you combine cards (even if it helps you)

    These effects affect your hand, deck, or card pool — creating strategic pressure

👹 Occultist — Passive Encounter Design
🔁 Turn Structure

    Start of Player Turn: Draw phase

    Player acts: Combine cards, play utilities

    Check win condition: Did the player create the Seal?

    If NOT: Occultist applies a Turn Effect

    If Player combined a card this turn: Occultist applies a Combo Punishment

💀 Occultist Effect Pool

Here’s a set of negative effects based on your categories:
❌ Combo Punishment Effects (if you combine cards this turn)
Name	Effect
Unstable Glyph	Adds a Cursed Talisman to your hand (dead card, can't be fused)
Fading Memory	Removes a random card from your deck
Seal Burn	Random card in your hand is destroyed
Reverse Flow	One card in hand becomes inverted (e.g., unusable or has reversed tag)

Choose 1 randomly or rotate through a list for predictability.
⌛ Turn-End Punishment Effects (if the player hasn’t won)
Turn	Effect
Turn 1	Adds a Cracked Binding to your deck (a fake talisman — waste)
Turn 2	Sealbreaker Curse: Random Binding Talisman in your deck is destroyed
Turn 3	Corrupts a card in your hand (adds the "Cursed" tag so it can’t be fused)
Turn 4	Discards your highest-cost card from hand
Turn 5	Final Warning — if Seal not complete, game over

You can also design enemy archetypes around these rules. Example:

    Cultist = curses your deck

    Chronomancer = increases fusion cost

    Shadow Mage = removes cards from hand

🎴 Simple Rule Engine for the Demo

You could build this logic as a simple function:

function endTurn(player, turn, combinedThisTurn) {
  if (!player.hasCompletedSeal()) {
    applyTurnEffect(turn);
  }
  if (combinedThisTurn) {
    applyComboPunishment();
  }
}

🛠 How This Feels in Play

    You must complete the Seal in 5 turns

    Every time you try to get closer, the Occultist pushes back

    You’re making hard decisions: "Do I combine now and risk a curse?" or "Hold and risk a seal piece getting destroyed?"

✅ What This System Accomplishes

    ✅ Replayability: You can rotate which punishments are active or randomized per run

    ✅ Tension: There's always pressure, but the system is predictable and strategic

    ✅ No AI Needed: It’s all deterministic logic you can handle via simple checks

    ✅ Extensible: Every enemy can have a unique combo/turn punishment set
